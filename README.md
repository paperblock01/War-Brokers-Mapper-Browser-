# War Brokers Mapper (Browser Version)

It can be accessed [here](https://paperblock01.github.io/War-Brokers-Mapper-for-Browser/)

I hope you can figure out how to use it because I don't want to make a detailed README lmao.

Infinite mapping was removed because it is too buggy on the browser.

Here is a python script version of it: https://github.com/paperblock01/wb_mapper
